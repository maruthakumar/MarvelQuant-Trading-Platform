### Recommendations
1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize chart loading time for slower connections
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Add ARIA labels and improve keyboard navigation
3. **User Guidance**: Add tooltips or guided tour for first-time users
4. **Signal Templates**: Provide pre-configured signal templates for common strategies

## Conclusion
The TradingView and Python integration components have been thoroughly tested and function as expected. The integration provides a seamless experience for users to execute multi-leg options strategies from both TradingView charts and Python applications. The components are stable, responsive, and ready for production use.

All critical functionality passed testing with no major issues identified. The minor issues and recommendations noted do not impact core functionality and can be addressed in future updates.
