        # Define parameters
        self.fast_period = self.param('fast_period', 10)
        self.slow_period = self.param('slow_period', 50)
        
        # Initialize indicators
        self.fast_ma = self.indicator(SMA, self.data.close, self.fast_period)
        self.slow_ma = self.indicator(SMA, self.data.close, self.slow_period)
    
    def next(self):
        """Main strategy logic - called for each new data point"""
        # Check for buy signal
        if self.fast_ma[-1] < self.slow_ma[-1] and self.fast_ma[0] > self.slow_ma[0]:
            if not self.position:
                # Calculate position size
                price = self.data.close[0]
                risk_amount = self.portfolio.equity * 0.02  # 2% risk
                size = risk_amount / price
                
                # Submit buy order
                self.buy(size, OrderType.MARKET)
        
        # Check for sell signal
        elif self.fast_ma[-1] > self.slow_ma[-1] and self.fast_ma[0] < self.slow_ma[0]:
            if self.position and self.position.is_long:

## Strategy Management Best Practices

### Development Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with straightforward strategies and add complexity gradually
- **Focus on Edge**: Identify a clear market inefficiency that your strategy exploits
- **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure your strategy works for logical reasons, not just because it fits historical data
- **Test Robustness**: Verify performance across different market conditions and instruments
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed notes on strategy logic, assumptions, and design decisions

### Testing Best Practices

- **Use Realistic Assumptions**: Configure backtests with conservative execution assumptions
- **Test Out-of-Sample**: Always validate on data not used during development
- **Consider Market Impact**: Account for how your orders might affect the market
- **Test Multiple Timeframes**: Verify performance across different data resolutions
- **Stress Test**: Evaluate performance during extreme market conditions

### Deployment Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with a small capital allocation and increase gradually
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch new strategies carefully during the first few weeks
- **Compare to Backtest**: Regularly compare live performance to backtest expectations
- **Set Clear Rules**: Define specific conditions for adjusting or stopping strategies
- **Maintain a Strategy Journal**: Document observations, issues, and adjustments

### Risk Management Best Practices

- **Diversify Strategies**: Deploy multiple uncorrelated strategies
- **Implement Circuit Breakers**: Set automatic shutdown conditions for extreme scenarios
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct periodic reviews of all running strategies
- **Adapt to Market Changes**: Be prepared to adjust or retire strategies as market conditions evolve
- **Maintain Reserve Capital**: Keep some capital in reserve for opportunities or emergencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backtest Results Differ from Live Performance

**Issue**: The strategy performs differently in live trading compared to backtests.

**Possible Causes**:
- Unrealistic backtest assumptions (slippage, commission, fill rates)
- Look-ahead bias in the strategy code
- Market conditions have changed since the backtest period
- Data quality issues in the backtest

**Solutions**:
- Review and adjust execution assumptions in backtests
- Check strategy code for inadvertent look-ahead bias
- Compare market conditions between backtest and live periods
- Verify historical data quality and adjust if necessary

#### Strategy Stops Generating Signals

**Issue**: A previously active strategy stops generating trading signals.

**Possible Causes**:
- Market conditions have changed
- Data feed issues
- Logic error in the strategy
- Parameter values no longer appropriate

**Solutions**:
- Analyze current market conditions relative to strategy assumptions
- Check data feed connectivity and quality
- Review strategy logic for conditional branches that might be blocking signals
- Consider re-optimizing parameters for current market conditions

#### Excessive Drawdown

**Issue**: Strategy experiences larger drawdowns than expected.

**Possible Causes**:
- Unexpected market volatility
- Correlation breakdown between assets
- Risk parameters too loose
- Execution issues (slippage, delays)

**Solutions**:
- Implement stricter risk controls
- Review position sizing methodology
- Add correlation-based risk management
- Improve execution quality or speed
- Consider pausing the strategy during extreme market conditions

#### Execution Issues

**Issue**: Orders are not executing as expected.

**Possible Causes**:
- Connectivity problems with broker/exchange
- Insufficient liquidity
- Order parameters outside market conditions
- API rate limiting

**Solutions**:
- Check connection status with broker/exchange
- Review order execution logs
- Adjust order parameters (price limits, time in force)
- Implement retry logic for failed orders
- Consider alternative execution venues
