### Common Issues

#### Performance Data Discrepancies

**Solutions**:
- Check the time period selection to ensure you're looking at the correct date range
- Verify that all deposits and withdrawals have been properly recorded
- Confirm that dividend and interest payments are included in return calculations
- Check if corporate actions (splits, mergers) have been properly accounted for
- Review the return calculation methodology (time-weighted vs. money-weighted)

#### Missing Positions

**Issue**: Some positions are not appearing in your portfolio.

**Solutions**:
- Check if the positions are in a different account that's not currently selected
- Verify that the trades were properly executed and confirmed
- Check if the positions have been filtered out by any active filters
- Ensure that the positions haven't been archived or marked as closed
- Contact support if you believe there's a data synchronization issue

#### Incorrect Cost Basis

**Issue**: The cost basis for some positions appears incorrect.

**Solutions**:
- Review the transaction history for the position to ensure all buys and sells are recorded
