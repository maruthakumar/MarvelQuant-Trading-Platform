# WebSocket Infrastructure Module Checkpoint

## Module Information
- **Module Name**: WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Version**: 9.2.0
- **Completion Date**: April 4, 2025
- **Status**: Completed

## Implementation Summary
The WebSocket infrastructure module has been successfully implemented and tested. This module provides the foundation for real-time communication between the frontend and backend components of the trading platform, which is essential for the TradingView and Python integration.

## Components Implemented
1. **WebSocket Server**
   - Go-based WebSocket server with gRPC integration
   - Authentication and security measures
   - Connection management system
   - Heartbeat mechanism for connection monitoring

2. **WebSocket Client**
   - React-based WebSocket client
   - Connection state management
   - Reconnection logic
   - Event listeners for incoming signals

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for WebSocket Provider
   - Unit tests for WebSocket Client
   - Connection management testing
   - Authentication flow testing
   - Reconnection logic testing

## Files Created/Modified
- `/implementation/websocket/WebSocketServer.go`
- `/implementation/websocket/WebSocketClient.tsx`
- `/implementation/websocket/WebSocketProvider.tsx`
- `/implementation/websocket/WebSocketStatus.tsx`
- `/tests/WebSocketProvider.test.tsx`
- `/tests/WebSocketClient.test.tsx`

## Documentation
- Updated TASKS.md to reflect WebSocket infrastructure completion
- Created WEBSOCKET_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md with detailed implementation information

## Next Steps
With the WebSocket infrastructure in place, the next phase is to implement the TradingView integration:
1. Create TradingView Chart Component
2. Implement TradingView Webhook Endpoint
3. Develop Pine Script Templates

## Notes
The WebSocket infrastructure implementation leverages existing code from previous versions of the trading platform. The implementation has been verified to be compatible with the requirements for TradingView and Python integration.

## Verification
- All WebSocket components have been tested and verified to work correctly
- Connection management, authentication, and reconnection logic have been tested
- The implementation follows best practices for WebSocket communication
