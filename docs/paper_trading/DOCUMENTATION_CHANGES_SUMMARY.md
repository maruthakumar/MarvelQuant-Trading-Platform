## New Documentation Files Created

### 1. PAPER_TRADING_WORKFLOW.md
Created a comprehensive workflow documentation for paper trading that includes:
- User workflows:
  - SIM user account creation
  - Switching between real and simulation modes
  - Paper trading order execution
  - Position management in simulation
  - Performance tracking and reporting
  - Strategy testing in simulation
- Technical workflows:
  - Simulation engine architecture
  - Database schema
  - Integration points
- Security and isolation considerations
- Error handling for simulation-specific scenarios

### 2. docs/paper_trading/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
Created a focused implementation plan for paper trading that includes:
- Detailed module descriptions for paper trading components
- Implementation steps for each module
- Deliverables for each module
- Timeline and dependencies
- Risk mitigation strategies specific to paper trading

## Documentation Organization

- Created a dedicated directory for paper trading documentation: `/docs/paper_trading/`
- Moved and adapted relevant documentation to this directory
- Maintained cross-references between general documentation and paper trading-specific documentation

## Next Steps for Documentation

The following documentation tasks remain to be completed:

1. Technical Documentation
   - Create/update database schema documentation to include SIM user tables
   - Update API documentation to include simulation-specific endpoints
   - Document the isolation between real and simulated trading
   - Update UI documentation to include simulation-specific components

2. Testing Documentation
   - Create test plans for paper trading features
   - Document test cases for simulation functionality
   - Include validation criteria for simulation accuracy

3. User Documentation
   - Create user guides for paper trading features
   - Include tutorials for setting up simulation accounts
   - Document best practices for using paper trading

4. Deployment Documentation
   - Update deployment documentation to include paper trading components
   - Document configuration options for simulation features
   - Include feature flag information for enabling/disabling paper trading

## Conclusion

The documentation updates provide a comprehensive framework for implementing paper trading functionality in the future. The updated documentation maintains consistency across all files and provides clear guidance for developers implementing these features. The paper trading environment will allow users to test trading strategies without risking real capital, enhancing the overall value of the trading platform.
