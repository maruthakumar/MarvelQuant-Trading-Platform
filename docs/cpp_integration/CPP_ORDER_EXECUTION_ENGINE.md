The C++ Order Execution Engine is a high-performance component designed to handle the most latency-sensitive aspects of the trading platform. By implementing the core order matching and execution logic in C++, we achieve significant performance improvements over a pure Go implementation, particularly for high-frequency trading scenarios.
