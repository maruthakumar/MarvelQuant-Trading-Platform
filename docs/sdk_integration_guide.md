# Trading Platform SDK Integration Guide

## SDK Distinctions

This document clarifies the different SDK integrations required for the Trading Platform:

### 1. XTS PRO SDK

- **Source**: Provided directly by the user (attached in previous sessions)
- **Status**: Already converted to Go implementation
- **Users**: XTS PRO users
- **Features**: 
  - Ultra-low latency execution
  - Advanced order types
  - Real-time market data
  - Portfolio management

### 2. XTS Client SDK

- **Source**: https://github.com/symphonyfintech/xts-pythonclient-api-sdk
- **Status**: Needs to be converted to Go with additional points compared to the standard SDK
- **Users**: XTS Client users
- **Features**:
  - Standard order execution
  - Market data access
  - Position management
  - May have different API endpoints and authentication mechanisms

### 3. Zerodha Integration

- **Source**: https://github.com/zerodha/gokiteconnect
- **Status**: Needs to be incorporated
- **Users**: Zerodha users
- **Features**:
  - Order placement and management
  - Market data access
  - Portfolio tracking
  - Zerodha-specific authentication and API endpoints

## Implementation Approach

### XTS PRO Implementation

The XTS PRO SDK has been implemented in Go with the following components:

- REST Client for API communication
- WebSocket clients for real-time data
- Service layer for business logic
- Models for data structures
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### XTS Client Implementation (To Be Completed)

For the XTS Client SDK implementation, we need to:

1. Analyze the differences between XTS PRO and XTS Client SDKs
2. Identify additional endpoints or parameters required
3. Implement client-specific authentication mechanisms
4. Adapt the existing Go implementation to support XTS Client features
5. Test with XTS Client credentials

### Zerodha Implementation (To Be Completed)

For the Zerodha integration, we need to:

1. Study the official Zerodha Go client (gokiteconnect)
2. Implement Zerodha-specific authentication
3. Create adapters to standardize the interface between different brokers
4. Implement Zerodha-specific order types and parameters
5. Test with Zerodha credentials

## Integration Strategy

To maintain a clean architecture while supporting multiple brokers:

1. **Common Interface**: Define common interfaces for order management, market data, etc.
2. **Broker-Specific Implementations**: Implement broker-specific adapters
3. **Factory Pattern**: Use a factory pattern to create the appropriate client based on configuration
4. **Feature Detection**: Detect and adapt to broker-specific features at runtime

## Directory Structure

The updated directory structure to accommodate multiple broker integrations:

```
trading-platform/
├── backend/
│   ├── cmd/
│   ├── internal/
│   │   ├── xts/
│   │   │   ├── pro/       # XTS PRO implementation
│   │   │   └── client/    # XTS Client implementation
│   │   ├── zerodha/       # Zerodha implementation

│   ├── xts_client_sdk/    # XTS Client Python SDK (reference)
│   └── oi_shift/          # OI-shift analysis implementation
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze XTS Client SDK**: Compare with XTS PRO SDK to identify differences
2. **Implement XTS Client Adapter**: Create Go implementation for XTS Client
3. **Implement Zerodha Integration**: Based on gokiteconnect
4. **Create Common Interface**: Define standard interfaces for all brokers
5. **Update Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of broker-specific features
