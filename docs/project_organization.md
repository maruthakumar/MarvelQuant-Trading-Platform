# Trading Platform Project Organization

## Directory Structure

The trading platform project has been organized into the following structure to maintain file integrity across multiple context windows and facilitate continued development:

```

```

## Key Components

### 1. Backend (Go)

The backend is implemented in Go and includes:

- **XTS Integration**: Native Go implementation of the XTS API based on the Python SDK reference
- **API Server**: RESTful API endpoints for trading operations
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time data streaming
- **Service Layer**: Business logic for trading operations

### 2. Python Components

The Python components include:

- **XTS SDK**: Reference implementation from Symphony Fintech
- **OI-Shift**: Open Interest analysis implementation

### 3. Documentation

The documentation includes:

- **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed design of the system
- **API Documentation**: API endpoints and usage
- **Progress Reports**: Implementation status and next steps

## Implementation Status

The current implementation status is approximately 15-20% complete:

- **Backend Gateway**: Partially implemented (~20%)
- **XTS Integration in Go**: Implemented based on Python SDK reference
- **OI-Shift Component**: Partially implemented
- **Frontend**: Not started
- **Infrastructure**: Not started

## Next Steps

The prioritized next steps for continued development are:

1. **Complete Backend Gateway Implementation**:
   - Finish WebSocket server for real-time updates
   - Complete service clients for internal communication
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **Set Up Infrastructure**:
   - Configure development environment
   - Set up database infrastructure (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB)
   - Configure Redis cache and message queuing

3. **Begin Frontend Development**:
   - Set up React/TypeScript project structure
   - Create responsive layout framework
   - Implement authentication UI and dashboard

4. **Integrate Python Components with Backend**:
   - Create API endpoints for OI-shift analysis
   - Integrate XTS SDK with Go backend
   - Implement data pipeline for analytics

## File Continuity Strategy

To maintain file integrity across multiple context windows:

1. **Use the Organized Structure**: Always work within the organized directory structure
2. **Reference Previous Files**: When needed, reference files from previous sessions
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with implementation progress
4. **Archive Regularly**: Create regular archives of the project for backup
5. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Maintain consistent file naming conventions

## Archive Contents

The `trading-platform-organized.zip` archive contains all necessary files for continued development, organized according to the structure described above. This archive should be used as the starting point for future development sessions.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Implementation Sequence**: Follow the prioritized todo list
2. **Testing**: Implement, test, and document each component thoroughly
3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout
5. **Performance**: Optimize for low latency, especially in trading operations
