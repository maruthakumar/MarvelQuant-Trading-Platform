# C++ Interface Layer Documentation

## Overview

The C++ Interface Layer provides a bridge between the Go backend and the C++ Order Execution Engine. This layer enables the Go code to interact with the high-performance C++ components while maintaining language boundaries and ensuring type safety.

## Architecture

The interface layer follows a C-style API design to facilitate interoperability between Go and C++:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │

```

## Components

### C++ Header Interface

The interface layer exposes a set of C-style functions that can be called from Go using CGO. These functions provide a simplified API for interacting with the C++ execution engine.

### Type Conversions

The interface layer handles type conversions between Go and C++ types:
- Converts Go strings to C++ strings and vice versa
- Converts Go structs to C++ objects and vice versa
- Manages memory allocation and deallocation

### Error Handling

The interface layer provides a consistent error handling mechanism:
- Returns error codes for function calls
- Provides error messages through output parameters
- Ensures proper cleanup in error cases

## API Functions

The interface layer provides the following key functions:

### Initialization and Cleanup

- `InitializeExecutionEngine()`: Initializes the execution engine
- `ShutdownExecutionEngine()`: Shuts down the execution engine and releases resources

### Order Management

- `SubmitOrder()`: Submits a new order to the execution engine
- `CancelOrder()`: Cancels an existing order
- `ModifyOrder()`: Modifies an existing order

### Symbol Management

- `AddSymbol()`: Adds a symbol to the execution engine
- `RemoveSymbol()`: Removes a symbol from the execution engine
- `GetSymbols()`: Gets the list of symbols managed by the execution engine

### Execution Reports

- `GetExecutionReports()`: Gets execution reports for a specific order or time range

### Market Data

- `SubscribeMarketData()`: Subscribes to market data for a symbol
- `UnsubscribeMarketData()`: Unsubscribes from market data for a symbol

## Memory Management

The interface layer carefully manages memory to prevent leaks:
- Uses smart pointers internally to manage C++ object lifetimes
- Provides explicit cleanup functions for resources allocated on behalf of Go
- Ensures proper destruction of C++ objects when they are no longer needed

## Thread Safety

The interface layer ensures thread safety:
- Protects shared resources with mutexes
- Ensures that callbacks from C++ to Go are thread-safe
- Handles concurrent calls from multiple Go goroutines

## Error Handling

The interface layer provides robust error handling:
- Returns error codes for all functions
- Provides detailed error messages
- Ensures cleanup in error cases
- Prevents C++ exceptions from propagating to Go

## Integration with Go

The interface layer is designed to be easily used from Go:
- Uses CGO to call C functions
- Provides Go-friendly type conversions
- Follows Go error handling conventions
- Integrates with Go's garbage collection

## Build and Deployment

The interface layer is built as part of the C++ execution engine:
- Compiled into a shared library (.so/.dll)
- Linked with the Go application
- Packaged with the application for deployment

## Testing

The interface layer includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for C++ side
- Integration tests with Go
- Tests for error conditions
- Tests for memory leaks

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the interface layer:
- Support for additional execution engine features
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced error reporting
- Support for additional market data types
