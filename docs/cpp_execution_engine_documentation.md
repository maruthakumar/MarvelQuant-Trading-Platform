# C++ Order Execution Engine Documentation

## Overview

The C++ Order Execution Engine is a high-performance component of the trading platform responsible for order matching, market data processing, and trade execution. It is designed with a focus on performance, reliability, and scalability to handle high-frequency trading scenarios.

## Architecture

The execution engine follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **OrderBook**: Maintains the state of buy and sell orders for each symbol
2. **Matching Engine**: Matches incoming orders against the order book
3. **Market Data Handler**: Processes and distributes market data
4. **Execution Engine**: Coordinates the overall execution process

## Components

### OrderBook

The OrderBook component maintains a collection of buy and sell orders for a specific symbol. It provides efficient access to the best bid and ask prices, as well as methods to add, remove, and query orders.

#### Key Classes

- `Order`: Represents a trading order with properties like ID, symbol, side, type, price, and quantity
- `PriceLevel`: Represents a collection of orders at a specific price level
- `OrderBook`: Maintains the state of all orders for a symbol

#### Features

- Efficient price level organization
- Thread-safe operations
- Support for different order types (market, limit)
- Support for different time-in-force options (day, GTC, IOC, FOK)

### Matching Engine

The Matching Engine component is responsible for matching incoming orders against the order book. It implements the order matching logic and generates trades when orders match.

#### Key Classes

- `Trade`: Represents a matched trade between a buy and sell order
- `TradeListener`: Interface for receiving trade notifications
- `MatchingEngine`: Implements the order matching logic

#### Features

- Price-time priority matching algorithm
- Support for market and limit orders
- Partial fills and order cancellation
- Asynchronous order processing

### Market Data Handler

The Market Data Handler component processes and distributes market data. It provides interfaces for subscribing to different types of market data and notifies listeners when new data arrives.

#### Key Classes

- `MarketDataMessage`: Base class for market data messages
- `TradeMessage`: Represents a trade in the market
- `QuoteMessage`: Represents a quote (bid/ask) in the market
- `BookUpdateMessage`: Represents an update to the order book
- `MarketDataListener`: Interface for receiving market data notifications
- `MarketDataHandler`: Manages market data subscriptions and distribution

#### Features

- Support for different types of market data (trades, quotes, book updates)
- Subscription-based model
- Simulation capabilities for testing

### Execution Engine

The Execution Engine component coordinates the overall execution process. It manages the interaction between the order book, matching engine, and market data handler.

#### Key Classes

- `ExecutionReport`: Represents the result of an order execution
- `ExecutionListener`: Interface for receiving execution reports
- `ExecutionEngine`: Coordinates the execution process

#### Features

- Order submission, cancellation, and modification
- Execution report generation
- Integration with market data
- Symbol management

## Performance Considerations

The C++ Order Execution Engine is designed with performance in mind:

- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses efficient data structures to minimize memory usage
- **Lock-Free Algorithms**: Employs lock-free algorithms where possible to reduce contention
- **Cache-Friendly Design**: Organizes data to maximize cache locality
- **Optimized Critical Paths**: Identifies and optimizes performance-critical code paths

## Thread Safety

The execution engine is designed to be thread-safe:

- Uses mutexes to protect shared data
- Uses atomic variables for lock-free operations
- Uses condition variables for thread synchronization
- Clearly defines thread ownership and responsibilities

## Error Handling

The execution engine includes robust error handling:

- Validates input parameters
- Checks for error conditions
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Maintains system integrity even in error conditions

## Integration with Go Backend

The C++ Order Execution Engine integrates with the Go backend through a C-style interface. This allows the Go code to call into the C++ code while maintaining the performance benefits of C++.

## Build and Deployment

The execution engine uses CMake as its build system:

- Supports different build configurations (Debug, Release)
- Manages dependencies
- Configures compiler flags
- Sets up testing infrastructure

## Testing

The execution engine includes comprehensive unit tests:

- Tests for each component (OrderBook, MatchingEngine, MarketDataHandler, ExecutionEngine)
- Tests for different scenarios (order matching, partial fills, cancellations)
- Tests for edge cases and error conditions
- Tests for performance characteristics

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the execution engine:

- Support for additional order types (stop, stop-limit)
- Support for additional time-in-force options
- Enhanced risk management features
- Performance optimizations
- Support for additional market data types
