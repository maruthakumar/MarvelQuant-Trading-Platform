## Implementation Timeline

The complete implementation is estimated to take approximately 34-44 weeks (8-10 months) with a team of skilled developers. This timeline can be adjusted based on resource availability and prioritization changes.

```
Months:     | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | M10|
Tasks:      |
1. Backend    [===]
2. Infra      [==]
3. Frontend     [====]
4. XTS           [==]
5. Execution      [=====]
6. Analytics        [====]
7. Portfolio          [====]
8. TradingView          [===]
9. Zerodha               [===]
10. Integration            [====]
```

## Next Steps

1. Begin with completing the backend gateway implementation as it serves as a foundation for other components
2. Set up the infrastructure in parallel to support development activities
3. Once the backend is stable, proceed with frontend development and order execution engine
4. Regularly review and adjust priorities based on progress and emerging requirements
