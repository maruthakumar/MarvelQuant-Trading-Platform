# Trading Platform Development Session Notes

## Session: April 4, 2025 - Version 9.2.0 Initialization

### Overview
Today's session focused on initializing version 9.2.0 of the trading platform, which will integrate TradingView and Python capabilities with the existing multi-leg trading component. This represents a significant enhancement to the platform's functionality, enabling users to execute strategies directly from TradingView charts and Python applications.

### Key Activities
1. Analyzed documentation from previous versions (v9.2.0 and v9.2.0)
2. Reviewed the TradingView and Python integration plan
3. Created updated project status tracking files
4. Established the framework for version 9.2.0

### Current Status
- Successfully completed modules 1-13 from previous versions
- Identified the next phases of development focusing on TradingView and Python integration
- Created comprehensive documentation structure for tracking progress

### Integration Plan Analysis
The TradingView and Python integration will be implemented in five phases:
1. WebSocket Infrastructure Setup (2 weeks)
2. TradingView Integration (3 weeks)
3. Python Integration (3 weeks)
4. Multi-Leg Component Enhancement (4 weeks)
5. Testing and Deployment (2 weeks)

### Technical Considerations
- WebSocket communication will be critical for real-time signal processing
- Security measures must be implemented for webhook endpoints
- Signal format standardization between TradingView and Python sources
- Performance optimization for low-latency trading operations

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of WebSocket infrastructure
   - Create WebSocket server using Go + gRPC
   - Develop WebSocket client in React for the Multi-Leg component
2. Set up testing environment for WebSocket communication
3. Document WebSocket protocol specifications

### Questions/Issues to Address
- Determine optimal authentication mechanism for WebSocket connections
- Establish error handling and reconnection protocols
- Define message format and serialization standards

### Resources Needed
- Go development environment for WebSocket server
- React components for WebSocket client integration
- Testing tools for WebSocket communication

### Notes for Next Session
- Focus on WebSocket server implementation
- Begin developing client-side connection management
- Create documentation for WebSocket protocol
