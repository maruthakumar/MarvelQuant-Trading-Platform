### 3. Technical Indicators
- **Basic Indicators**: Calculate basic technical indicators:
  - Moving Averages (SMA, EMA, WMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Stochastic Oscillator
- **Advanced Indicators**: Calculate advanced technical indicators:
  - Fibonacci Retracement
  - Ichimoku Cloud
  - Volume Profile
  - Market Profile
  - Order Flow Analysis

### 4. Data Storage
- **Time-Series Database**: Store historical market data in a time-series database
- **Cache**: Cache frequently accessed data for performance
- **Data Retention**: Define data retention policies for different types of data

### 5. Data Access
- **REST API**: Provide REST API endpoints for retrieving market data

- **Pagination**: Support pagination for large data sets
- **Filtering**: Support filtering data by various criteria

### 6. Integration
- **Order Execution Engine**: Integrate with the Order Execution Engine for order placement and management
- **Strategy Engine**: Provide data to the Strategy Engine for strategy execution
- **Frontend**: Provide data to the frontend for visualization and analysis
- **Backtesting Engine**: Provide historical data for backtesting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **Latency**: Minimize latency for real-time data (target < 100ms)
- **Throughput**: Handle high throughput of market data (thousands of updates per second)
- **Scalability**: Scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes and user load

### 2. Reliability
- **Availability**: Ensure high availability (target 99.9% uptime)

### 3. Security
- **Authentication**: Secure access to market data with proper authentication
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control for different data types
- **Data Protection**: Protect sensitive market data from unauthorized access
- **Audit Logging**: Log all access to market data for audit purposes

### 4. Maintainability
- **Modularity**: Design the service with modular components for easy maintenance
- **Testability**: Ensure all components are testable with automated tests
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for all components
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting for all critical components

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Architecture
- **Microservice Architecture**: Implement as a microservice with clear boundaries
- **API-First Design**: Design APIs before implementation
- **Event-Driven**: Use event-driven architecture for real-time data processing
- **Stateless**: Design stateless services where possible for scalability

### 2. Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Go (consistent with other backend services)
- **Database**: TimescaleDB for time-series data
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and pub/sub
- **Message Queue**: NATS or Kafka for event streaming
- **API Gateway**: Use existing API gateway for routing and authentication
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerization
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for orchestration

### 3. Development
- **Version Control**: Git for version control
- **CI/CD**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance testing
- **Code Quality**: Static code analysis and code reviews
- **Documentation**: API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

## User Stories

1. As a trader, I want to see real-time market data for my watchlist so that I can make informed trading decisions.
2. As a trader, I want to see historical price charts with technical indicators so that I can analyze market trends.
3. As a strategy developer, I want to access historical market data so that I can backtest my trading strategies.
4. As a portfolio manager, I want to see real-time portfolio performance based on market data so that I can monitor my investments.
5. As a risk manager, I want to receive alerts when market conditions meet certain criteria so that I can manage risk effectively.
6. As a system administrator, I want to monitor the performance of the market data service so that I can ensure optimal operation.
7. As a developer, I want to access market data through a well-documented API so that I can build custom applications.

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Data Source Limitations**: Some data sources may have rate limits or usage restrictions
