# MarvelQuant Trading Platform Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
This document details the enhancements made to the MarvelQuant Trading Platform version 10.3.3, focusing on UI improvements and login functionality fixes.

## 1. Logo Size and Placement Enhancement

### Issue
The logo in the top navigation panel was too small and not clearly visible. Additionally, there were duplicate logos appearing in different panels.

### Solution
- Increased the logo size in the top navigation panel from 40x40px to 80px height with auto width
- Increased the toolbar height from 48px to 80px to properly accommodate the larger logo
- Removed duplicate logos to ensure only one clear logo appears in the interface
- Maintained the larger logo (80px height) on the login page for brand prominence

### Implementation Details
Modified the `LiveRateDisplay.jsx` component:
```jsx
// Changed from
<Box 
  component="img"
  src="/images/MQ-Logo-Main.svg"
  alt="MarvelQuant"
  sx={{ 
    height: 40, 
    width: 40,
    mr: 3,
    display: 'block'
  }}
/>

// Changed to
<Box 
  component="img"
  src="/images/MQ-Logo-Main.svg"
  alt="MarvelQuant"
  sx={{ 
    height: 80, 
    width: 'auto',
    mr: 3,
    display: 'block'
  }}
/>
```

Also increased the toolbar height:
```jsx
// Changed from
<Toolbar variant="dense" sx={{ minHeight: '48px !important' }}>

// Changed to
<Toolbar sx={{ minHeight: '80px !important' }}>
```

## 2. Login Page Functionality Fix

### Issue
The login page was not accessible in some cases, and the authentication flow had issues with redirects.

### Solution
- Fixed the authentication check logic to ensure proper redirection to the login page
- Improved the redirect mechanism to prevent redirect loops
- Updated the catch-all route to direct unauthenticated users to the login page
- Ensured the login works with the specified credentials (9986666444/password123)

### Implementation Details
Modified the `AppRouter.jsx` component:
```jsx
// Changed from
useEffect(() => {
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  if (path === '/' || path === '') {
    const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem('isAuthenticated') === 'true';
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      // Redirect to login if not authenticated
      window.location.href = '/login';
    }
  }
}, []);

// Changed to
useEffect(() => {
  const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem('isAuthenticated') === 'true';
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  
  // If not authenticated and not already on login page, redirect to login
  if (!isAuthenticated && path !== '/login') {
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
}, []);
```

Also updated the catch-all route:
```jsx
// Changed from
<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />

// Changed to
<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/login" replace />} />
```

## 3. Sidebar Configuration

### Issue
The sidebar needed to match the plain design shown in Quantiply.mkv with proper expansion/collapse functionality.

### Solution
- Updated the sidebar to match the plain design from Quantiply.mkv
- Implemented proper expansion/collapse functionality with the toggle at the bottom
- Fixed the top panel to properly overlap the sidebar as shown in the reference
